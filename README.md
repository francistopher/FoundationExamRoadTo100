# Foundation Exam Road To 100

There were a few instances were I started falling asleep during CS1. Most of the time, I wanted to go to sleep. I learn C by programming in C not by watching powerpoint presentations. I earned a 75 on my final and a B in the course. All while working about 30 hours a week as a pizza maker/delivery driver, not too bad but a B is not an A. However, some A students end up working for B students. Hopefully, I'm that B student. Going from 75 to 100 is possible, not impossible. Small probability, if there's a will, there's a way.
